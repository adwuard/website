# Raspberry Pi Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a powerful, low-cost microcontroller board built around the RP2040 chip, designed by Raspberry Pi in the UK. With its dual-core processor, flexible I/O options, and excellent development ecosystem, the Pico is ideal for a wide range of embedded projects, from simple LED controllers to complex IoT applications.

## Key Features

- **RP2040 Microcontroller**: Custom-designed by Raspberry Pi
- **Dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+** processor running at up to 133 MHz
- **264KB SRAM** and **2MB QSPI Flash** memory
- **26 multi-function GPIO pins** with 3 analog inputs
- **Versatile peripheral support**: UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, and more
- **USB 1.1** with host and device support
- **Programmable I/O (PIO)** for custom peripheral support
- **Low power consumption** with sleep and dormant modes
- **Drag-and-drop programming** via USB mass storage
- **Castellated edges** for easy soldering to carrier boards

## Programming Options

The Raspberry Pi Pico supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels:

### MicroPython

MicroPython provides a full Python 3 implementation that runs directly on the Pico:

- Interactive REPL prompt via USB Serial
- Built-in filesystem
- Specific modules for accessing low-level hardware
- Easy installation via drag-and-drop UF2 file
- Excellent for beginners while still allowing advanced features

### CircuitPython

An alternative Python implementation with some key differences:

- Extensive library support for sensors and components
- Well-supported by Adafruit
- Compatible with the Mu editor
- Great for projects requiring external hardware components

### C/C++

The official Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK offers:

- Maximum performance and hardware control
- IDE support for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse
- Foundation SDK that other language ports use
- Ideal for complex or performance-critical applications

### Other Languages

- **JavaScript**: Available through Kaluma, a tiny JavaScript runtime

## Getting Started

1. Connect your Pico to a computer while holding the BOOTSEL button
2. The Pico will appear as a mass storage device called RPI-RP2
3. Drag and drop either the MicroPython UF2 file or your compiled program
4. The device will reboot automatically and run your code

## Project Ideas

The Raspberry Pi Pico is versatile enough for a wide range of applications:

### Beginner Projects

- **LED Blinking**: The "Hello World" of microcontrollers
- **LED Patterns**: Create firefly effects or beating heart simulations
- **Sound Machine**: Generate simple tones with a buzzer
- **Mood Indicator**: Use LEDs to reflect environmental conditions

### Intermediate Projects

- **Weather Station**: Monitor temperature, humidity, and pressure
- **Data Logger**: Record sensor data to the onboard flash
- **Home Automation**: Control relays for lights or appliances
- **Interactive Displays**: Drive small LCDs or OLED screens

### Advanced Projects

- **Heart Rate Monitor**: Process and visualize biometric data
- **Audio Spectrum Analyzer**: Visualize sound frequencies in real-time
- **Multi-Sensor Systems**: Combine multiple sensors for complex applications
- **IoT Devices**: Connect to the internet using the Pico W variant

## Variants

The Raspberry Pi Pico family includes several variants:

- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: The standard model
- **Raspberry Pi Pico H**: Includes pre-soldered headers
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**: Adds 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.2
- **Raspberry Pi Pico WH**: Combines Wi-Fi/Bluetooth with pre-soldered headers
